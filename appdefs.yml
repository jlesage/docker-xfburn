      Xfburn is an easy to use burning software. It uses libburn and libisofs as a
      backend, in difference to most other GUI programs at the moment.

      - title: Access to Optical Drive(s)
        level: 2
        content: |-
          By default, a Docker container doesn't have access to host's devices.  However,
          access to one or more device can be granted with the `--device DEV` parameter.

          Optical drives usually have `/dev/srX` as device.  For example, the first drive
          is `/dev/sr0`, the second `/dev/sr1`, and so on.  To provide {{ app.friendly_name }}
          access to the first drive, this parameter is needed:
          ```
          --device /dev/sr0
          ```

          To easily find devices associated to optical drives, start the container and
          look at its log for messages similar to these ones:
          ```
          ...
          [cont-init.d] 54-check-optical-drive.sh: executing...
          [cont-init.d] 54-check-optical-drive.sh: looking for usable optical drives...
          [cont-init.d] 54-check-optical-drive.sh: found optical drive /dev/sr0, but it is not usable because is not exposed to the container.
          [cont-init.d] 54-check-optical-drive.sh: no usable optical drive found.
          [cont-init.d] 54-check-optical-drive.sh: exited 0.
          ...
          ```
